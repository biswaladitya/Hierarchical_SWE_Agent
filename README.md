# SWE-Agent

SWE-Agent is a framework designed to orchestrate autonomous, multi-agent systems focused on software engineering tasks. It leverages a team of specialized agents to process issues, propose solutions, review code, and finalize changes, all under customizable constraints. SWE-Agent aims to streamline and partially automate tasks traditionally handled by human developers, from initial issue triage to code refinement and integration.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration:**  
  SWE-Agent coordinates multiple specialized agents that collectively perform tasks such as code generation, code review, and requirement analysis, offering a more holistic approach than a single-agent system.

- **Configurable Constraints:**  
  Easily adjust time, computational, or cost constraints. This flexibility ensures that SWE-Agent can adapt to different scales, budgets, and resource availabilities.

- **Task Decomposition:**  
  Complex issues can be decomposed into subtasks, enabling agents to work in parallel or in sequence, depending on the complexity and nature of the problem.

- **Extensible Architecture:**  
  The framework is designed for extensibility, allowing you to plug in new agent types or integrate with additional tools and APIs.

## Documentation

For a comprehensive overview, including installation, configuration details, agent roles, and advanced usage scenarios, please refer to the official SWE-Agent documentation:

[**SWE-Agent Documentation**](https://swe-agent.com/latest/)

This documentation includes topics such as:

- **Getting Started:** Basic installation and usage instructions.
- **Agent Types:** Detailed descriptions of each agent’s functionality and responsibilities.
- **Configuration Files:** How to customize the framework’s behavior using YAML configuration files.
- **Complex Pipelines:** Guidance on orchestrating multiple agents for large-scale or intricate tasks.
- **Best Practices:** Tips and recommendations for optimizing performance, maintaining cost-efficiency, and ensuring code quality.

## Why Docker?

We strongly recommend using a Docker-based approach to run SWE-Agent. By using Docker, you:

- **Ensure Consistency:** All agents and dependencies run in a controlled environment, reducing "it works on my machine" issues.
- **Streamline Setup:** Quickly spin up and tear down environments without manual dependency installations or version conflicts.
- **Ease of Deployment:** Deploy SWE-Agent to various platforms (local, cloud, CI/CD pipelines) without environment-specific configurations.

## Quick Start with Docker

1. **Prerequisites:**  
   - Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your system.
   - Clone this repository or have the necessary files available locally.

2. **Build the Docker Image (if you have a Dockerfile):**  
   ```bash
   docker build -t swe-agent:latest .
